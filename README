OVERVIEW
========

SmppServer is a special Kannel box that listens for smpp connections and accepts
and sends sms messages from and to smpp clients.

SmppServer behaves similar to other Kannel boxes and share a compatible
configuration file format and command line options.


INSTALLATION
============
Please read the INSTALL file for further instructions. If in a hurry, the quick
explanation is:

./bootstrap
./configure
make

And finally, as root:

make install

You need to have a development version of Kannel installed in order to compile
SmppServer.

The Userguide has also valuable information about the install and configuration
steps. To create the userguide, run ./configure with --enable-docs and then
type "make docs".
